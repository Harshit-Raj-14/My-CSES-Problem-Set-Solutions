/*
LOGIC---
The number of trailing zeroes in any factorial of a number is equal to the occurence of 10 in that number as a multiplicant.
Now where this 10 comes from, obviously- 5x2=10
So, if w ethink about the number of 2's and 5's occuring in n!
Occurence of 2 > Occurence of 5
So, we can be sure that the occurence of 10 == occurence of 5

We already know the formula:
f(5) = Summation of(Math.floor(n/5) + Math.floor(n/5^2) + Math.floor(n/5^3) + .... Math.floor(n/5^k)) till the value becoems zero


Conclusion:
A trailing zero is always produced by prime factors 2 and 5.
Trailing 0s in n! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!
                  = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....
