/*
LOGIC---
This question is basically permutation and combination.
When saying bit string -> the string is only made up of 0 and 1.

Here, n is actually the length of string.


So, if n=3
We have three places : _ _ _
We have two chocies either 0 or 1 to place in each box.

So, possible numebr of bit strings of length 3 = 2*2*2 = 8

But since we are asked to print the answer as modulo 10^9 +7
We need to beware that there are several n vlaues where the ans will overflow.

So, we will moduli each step where our answer might overflow.
